# Timelapse Footage Brightness Adjuster

## Overview

This repository provides a solution for addressing brightness changes in timelapse footage caused by variations in camera settings, such as shutter speed adjustments during shooting.

## How it Works

The included Jupyter notebook offers a straightforward method to analyze and fix brightness inconsistencies in your timelapse footage. By applying histogram mathing, you can achieve a smoother and more visually appealing timelapse video.
